# What is LINSTOR;

LINSTOR developed by LINBIT, is a software that manages DRBD replicated LVM/ZFS volumes across a group of machines. It maintains DRBD configuration on the participating machines. It creates/deletes the backing LVM/ZFS volumes. It automatically places the backing LVM/ZFS volumes among the participating machines. 
LINSTOR supports [Kubernetes](https://www.linbit.com/kubernetes/), [Openstack](https://www.linbit.com/openstack/), [Open Nebula](https://www.linbit.com/opennebula/), [Openshift](https://www.linbit.com/openshift-persistent-container-storage-support/), [VMware](https://www.linbit.com/linstor-vsan-software-defined-storage-for-vmware%e2%80%8b/). 

# How it works;

LINSTOR system consists of multiple server and client components.
A LINSTOR controller manages the configuration of the LINSTOR cluster and all of its managed storage resources.
The LINSTOR satellite component manages creation, modification and deletion of storage resources on each node that provides or uses storage resources managed by LINSTOR.
The storage system can be managed by directly using a command line utility to interact with the active LINSTOR controller. Alternatively, users may integrate the LINSTOR system into the storage architecture of other software systems, such as Kubernetes.
All communication between LINSTOR components uses LINSTORâ€™s own network protocol, based on TCP/IP network connections.

### User Guide
You need at least 3 nodes to use LINSTOR. Linstor-controller role must be installed on one node and all nodes must be installed with linstor-satellite, and linstor-client.

LINSTOR can also perform disk operations without using DRBD. However, if replication with DRBD is desired, DRBD 9 must be installed on all servers. For DRBD installation, please follow [this link](https://www.linbit.com/drbd-user-guide/drbd-guide-9_0-en/).

For a more detailed installation guide, please follow the link below.

### Releases
Releases generated by git tags on github are snapshots of the git repository at the given time. You most likely do not want to use these. They might lack things such as generated man pages, the configure script, and other generated files. If you want to build from a tarball, use the ones [provided by us](https://www.linbit.com/en/drbd-community/drbd-download/) .



### Building
Gradle is used for building linstor. On a fresh git clone some protobuf java files need to be generated and for that a fitting proto compiler is needed. So before building you need to run:
```sh
$ gradle getProtoc
```
After the correct proto compiler is installed in the ./tools directory you can build with:
```sh
$ gradle assemble
```
### Development
Please check the development documentation for details.
